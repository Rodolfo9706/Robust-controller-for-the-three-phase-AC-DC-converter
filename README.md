# Robust-controller-for-the-three-phase-AC-DC-converter
When controlling AC/DC converters, disturbances in the output voltage affect system behavior. This study presents a Lyapunov-based nonlinear controller to regulate the output voltage of a three-phase AC/DC converter, ensuring global stability in finite time despite disturbances. Simulations and software-in-the-loop experiments  are presented
