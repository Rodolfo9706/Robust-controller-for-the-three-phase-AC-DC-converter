# **Robust Regulation and PSpice Validation of Three-Phase AC/DC Converters**

This project contains simulations and validations for **three-phase rectifiers** using **Simulink** and **PSpice**, focusing on robust regulation. No programming is required; simply download the files and run the simulations.

## **Project Overview**  
The project explores the modeling and simulation of three-phase AC/DC converters, combining electrical circuit simulation tools like **OrCAD PSpice** with control systems implemented in **Simulink**. The system's performance is validated both at the circuit level and through mathematical models to ensure robustness under different operating conditions.

## **Project Structure**  
The repository contains the following folders:  

1. **PSpice_files/**  
   - Electrical circuits of the three-phase rectifier.
   - Simulation at the component level using **PSpice**.

2. **Simulink_Simulation/**  
   - Complete simulations of the rectifier using **Power Electronics Toolbox** in Simulink.
   - Includes the **control system** implemented to regulate the output.

3. **matlab_files/**  
   - Mathematical models of the rectifier and the controller.
   - Numerical simulations using MATLAB/Simulink.
